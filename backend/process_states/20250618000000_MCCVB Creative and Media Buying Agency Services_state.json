Similarly, 'Campaign Launch - Phase 2' (Task 15) should depend on both 'Creative Asset Production - Phase 2' (Task 13) and 'Media Buying and Placement - Phase 2' (Task 14), but the Gantt chart only shows 'after 13'. \\n2. The Gantt chart uses durations in hours, but does not specify actual dates for each task, except for the project start. This may cause confusion for longer tasks and for tasks that can run in parallel. \\n3. Consider using 'after task_id' for all dependencies, and for tasks with multiple dependencies, use the correct Mermaid syntax (e.g., 'after 8,9').\\n\\nSuggested revision: \\n- Correct the Gantt dependencies to reflect all required predecessors for each task, especially for tasks with multiple dependencies.\\n- Optionally, clarify the date/duration format or use days for better readability.\"}"

The task dependencies in the Gantt chart are not fully accurate. For example, 'Campaign Launch - Phase 1' (Task 10) should depend on both 'Creative Asset Production - Phase 1' (Task 8) and 'Media Buying and Placement - Phase 1' (Task 9), but the Gantt chart only shows it as 'after 8'. Similarly, 'Campaign Launch - Phase 2' (Task 15) should depend on both 'Creative Asset Production - Phase 2' (Task 13) and 'Media Buying and Placement - Phase 2' (Task 14), but the Gantt chart only shows 'after 13'. \n2. The Gantt chart uses durations in hours, but does not specify actual dates for each task, except for the project start. This may cause confusion for longer tasks and for tasks that can run in parallel. \n3. Consider using 'after task_id' for all dependencies, and for tasks with multiple dependencies, use the correct Mermaid syntax (e.g., 'after 8,9').\n\nSuggested revision: \n- Correct the Gantt dependencies to reflect all required predecessors for each task, especially for tasks with multiple dependencies.\n- Optionally, clarify the date/duration format or use days for better readability.\n\n            ** IMPORTANT: Only output the markdown content as a independent file, do not output as a chat response. **\n            "
