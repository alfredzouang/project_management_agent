**Notes:**  
- Task durations are now aligned with estimated effort (8 hours = 1 day, rounded up).
- All tasks are marked as 'Not Started' in both the table and Gantt chart for consistency.
- Multiple dependencies in the Gantt chart use the correct Mermaid syntax (multiple 'after' statements).
- The Gantt chart starts from the actual project start date and calculates subsequent dates based on dependencies and durations.
- Parent/child relationships are reflected in the outline levels and task dependencies.
- Please adjust actual dates and durations as per real project scheduling and resource availability.
- "assigned_to" values are mock resource placeholders and should be updated with real team assignments.
