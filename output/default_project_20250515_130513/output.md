**Note**:  
- Task durations in the Gantt are approximate and based on the effort estimates in the task table. They can be adjusted to reflect actual scheduling needs.
- Parallelism is shown where multiple tasks can progress after common dependencies are met.
- Some lower-level tasks (e.g., feature integration, assets, QA steps) can overlap as the project may allow flexible scheduling among disciplines.
