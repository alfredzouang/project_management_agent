# Project Description

**Project Name:** Snake Eat Eggs Game Project  
**Project Description:**  
This project is about creating a Snake Eat Eggs game. The objective is to design, develop, test, and deliver a classic snake game as a desktop and mobile application. The game will feature a snake controlled by the player that grows longer as it eats eggs, with increasing difficulty levels and score tracking. The project encompasses requirements gathering, UI/UX design, core game logic development, asset production, testing, deployment, and documentation.
