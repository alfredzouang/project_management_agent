**Notes on Gantt Adjustments:**
- Dependencies are adjusted so that tasks such as "Integrate UI with Game Logic" and "Integrate Game Assets" start only after all their required dependencies (multiple tasks) are completed.
- Duration units are mapped as: 1 day = 8 hours, 0.5 day = 4 hours.
- Parallelizable tasks (for example, asset creation and design sub-tasks) are shown to start together once their dependencies are met.
- The project chart above is aligned with the task list table structure and dependencies.
