**Note:**  
- Task durations are estimated and expressed in "days" for illustration. Each "day" equates to a block of the task's estimated effort (rounded for logical flow).
- The dependencies and child/parent relationships are reflected in both the table and the diagram for transparency and traceability.
- The timeline (start date: 2024-05-08) and sequencing respects task dependencies.
