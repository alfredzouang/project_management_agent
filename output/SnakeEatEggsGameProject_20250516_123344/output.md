# Task Gantt Diagram

> **Note:** 1 day = 8 hours of work. Task durations are rounded up to the nearest whole day.  
> **Important:** Some tasks (such as Task 7 and Task 8) have multiple dependencies in the original plan. Since Mermaid Gantt charts only support a single dependency per task, the chart below represents the primary dependency for each such task. For full accuracy, please refer to the Task List Table above.
