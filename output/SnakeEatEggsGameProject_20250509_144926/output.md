# Project Description

**Project Name:** SnakeEatEggsGameProject

**Description:**  
This project is about creating a Snake Eat Eggs Game. The aim is to design and develop a game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game area, eating eggs to score points and grow longer, while avoiding obstacles and itself. The project involves all phases from requirements gathering, design, architecture, implementation, testing, release, and deployment.
