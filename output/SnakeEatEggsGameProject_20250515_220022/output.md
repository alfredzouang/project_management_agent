# Task Gantt Diagram

> **Note:** The following Gantt chart has been revised to better reflect actual dependencies and parallelism. Tasks that can run in parallel are grouped accordingly, and dependencies are explicitly shown using 'after [task id]'. This is still a simplified view; for full project management, a dedicated tool is recommended.
