# SnakeEatEggsGameProject

## Project Description

**SnakeEatEggsGameProject** is a software development initiative focused on creating a modern version of the classic snake game. The player will control a snake to consume eggs appearing on the screen, growing in size and accumulating points while avoiding collisions with itself or the walls. The project encompasses all phases including requirements gathering, design, development, asset creation, testing, bug fixing, documentation, and release processes.
