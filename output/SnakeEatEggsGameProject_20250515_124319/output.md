# Project Description

**Project Name:** SnakeEatEggsGameProject  
**Description:**  
This project is about creating a "Snake Eat Eggs" game, where players control a snake to collect eggs, grow longer, and avoid obstacles. The gameplay, assets, UI, sound, and deployment will all be handled through a defined software development lifecycle, culminating in a release for the target platforms.
