# SnakeEatEggsGameProject

## Project Description

This project is about creating a "Snake Eat Eggs" game. The goal is to develop a complete playable game from initial requirements gathering, design, asset creation, development, testing, and deployment to the selected platform(s). The workflow encompasses all key steps: requirements gathering, game design documentation, asset production, development (including UI, logic, and integration), testing (unit, integration, QA), bug fixing, release management, user documentation, and go-live deployment.

*Note:*
- The Mermaid Gantt syntax only allows a single dependency per task. For tasks with **multiple dependencies (e.g., 7a, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17)**, the diagram places the task after the latest logically required predecessor. Actual project management and scheduling should coordinate all dependencies as listed in the table.
- Durations are in days for readability, with 1d representing 8 working hours. Adjust parallelization and scheduling as needed in actual planning.
- For comprehensive visualization of multiple dependencies and true parallelism, consider using a dedicated project management tool.
