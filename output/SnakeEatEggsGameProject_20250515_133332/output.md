**Note:**  
- Task durations in the diagram are now better aligned with estimated effort (typically allowing 2d for every 8 hours of effort; 1d for 4 hours or less).  
- Task dependency relationships are now more explicit, especially for tasks with multiple dependencies (e.g., "after aX, aY").  
- All tasks from the task list are now represented in the Gantt, ensuring full project visibility.  
- Sequence and dependency logic strictly follow the provided structure, though actual project scheduling may differ depending on team resource allocation.  
- For readability, the most significant relationships and parallelization/serial sequences are shown.
