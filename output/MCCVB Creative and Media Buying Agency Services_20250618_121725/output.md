**Notes:**
- Task dependencies are based on the "dependent_task" and hierarchy from the outline_level/parent_task/child_tasks fields.
- The Gantt chart now uses days for durations and clarifies dependencies, especially for tasks with multiple predecessors (e.g., `after 8,9`).
- Adjust start dates/times and durations as needed based on your actual schedule and project management practices.
