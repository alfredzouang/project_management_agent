# Project Description

**Project Name:** SnakeEatEggsGameProject  
**Description:**  
This project is about creating a "Snake Eat Eggs" game. The scope includes requirements gathering, designing, development, testing, release preparation, and post-release support for a game where the player controls a snake that consumes eggs as its main gameplay mechanic. The project will be structured into several key phases, ensuring an organized and efficient approach from inception to post-release maintenance.
